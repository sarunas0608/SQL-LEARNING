# Hi, I'm Šarūnas Vembutas 👋

I am a former **Structural Engineer** with 5 years of experience, now transitioning into the world of **Data**. I am starting from zero and documenting my entire journey here.

### 🚀 What I am doing right now
* 📖 Learning **SQL** basics with the "Data with Baraa" course.
* 🛠️ Practicing SQL on datalemur, sqlzoo, hackerrank.
* ✍️ Documenting my progress and saving my practice scripts.

### 🎯 My Simple Roadmap
1. **Phase 1: SQL** (Current) - Learning how to talk to databases.
2. **Phase 2: Excel** - Learning how to organize and analyze data.
3. **Phase 3: Visualization** - Learning how to create charts (Power BI or Tableau).
4. **Phase 4: Career** - Landing my first job as a Data Analyst/engineer/scientist.

### 🏗️ Why the switch?
After 5 years of building physical structures, I want to use my engineering logic to build "data structures" and find insights that help businesses grow.
